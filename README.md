#Media Format

The SportScanner scanner currently requires a very specific folder/filename setup to work properly. This is not good and is not intended to stay this way and will be extended over time to gather information from more places than just the filename and the first level folder. 

So create a library of type "TV Show" with the SportScanner scanner and metadata agent selected. In this example we will call it ~/LibraryRoot/. The next level of directories should be the name of the sport as defined by www.thesportsdb.com. Some examples are included below.

~/LibraryRoot/Soccer/
~/LibraryRoot/Ice Hockey/
~/LibraryRoot/Motorsport/

Inside this directory you can dump all files that you want to be scanned and added but there are requirement for what must be in the filename.

 - League Name
 - Date
 - Title

An example filename would be:

 - EPL.2015.08.30.Swansea-City.vs.Manchester-United.720p.HDTV.30fps.x264-Reborn4HD.mkv

Currently there is a gap between the name of a league as defined in the filename and the name of the league as defined in www.thesportsdb.com so there is a gross mapping between common mismatches in the metadata agent. This is not intended to stay.

If you stick to this format then everything should work nicely :)
